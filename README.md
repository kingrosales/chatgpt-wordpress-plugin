# chatgpt-wordpress-post-creator-plugin
This plugin takes an input of any topic then creates a new post in WordPress using the input as the title of the new post and uses ChatGPT to generate the copy of the post.

How To Use:

To use this plugin, simply copy and paste the code into a new PHP file, save it as chatgpt-post-creator.php, and upload it to your WordPress site's wp-content/plugins directory. Then activate the plugin from the WordPress admin dashboard.

You can then use the shortcode [chatgpt_form] to display the form on any post or page, or you can include the form in a template file using the PHP function echo do_shortcode('[chatgpt_form]');.
